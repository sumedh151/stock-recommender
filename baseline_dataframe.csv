GME,"An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.

ETF,"I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positionsTLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

DAY,"I feel like clarification is needed about TodayThere’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions. 

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

LET,"Why the fuck are we acting like we lost? We made GME go from 4 to 400 and it took combined trading platforms to silence and cheat to bring it to 90.Did everyone forget what happened in Thursday? That was a calculated effort to bring down our position. FUCK OFF BILLIONAIRS, well still take you fucking money; who do you think will fund our food stamps?

We didn’t “lose” because we made a bad call, we “lost” because we made the RIGHT call and this disturbed  some folks at the top. 

I was reading 2 articles in Wall Street journal and it made my blood boil- first article was saying “random penny stock went up 30% with no news or announcement”- the people that are paid to predict and report and are the expert at stock market are saying this shit. The second article right after made me want to fuck the writers wife: “GME and AMC, Reddit favorite stocks, plunged after apparent loss in interest from retail investors” LOSS IN  INTEREST? MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN ONLY BUY 5 FUCKING SHARES EACH. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK. THOSE FUCKS JUST DON’T LET US BUY IT. How is GameStop and AMC and BB not already suing robinhood? Is any stock expert really gonna act like had they not restricted in Thursday, it would have went down that much? 

What the fuck is this gaslighting? That last week didn’t happen? Why are every news channel acting like they called GME or BB or AMC falling like it happened organically and not deliberately by everyone involved? 

Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn’t matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down. 

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday.

GME,"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.Edit 2/1:  I’ve been banned my WSB mods from posting. Can any mods help me get unbanned? I’m thinking it’s a rogue mod who’s angry I posted about GME and SLV both being squeeze plays.  Note I also posted about SLV before all this conspiracy stuff including weeks ago. 

The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.  

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",74499
AMC,"The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fightIf you haven’t been browsing WSB or doing your own research, you’d probably think that the people on Twitter are correct in saying there is a silver squeeze happening and we should all get in on it. There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. 

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. 

If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME.

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

RIE,"A dark part WallStreetBets history, and why it's important for you to know and rememberEdit 02/04: not a week since this post was made, here we fucking go again. History rhymes and people don’t fucking learn. If 🅱️artek didn’t get away with it, you won’t either. 

Edit 02/04 #2: [We did it Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvluc/an_update_on_the_wsb_coup_d%C3%A9tat/)! 


tl;dr on tl;dr: Founder bad, greedy, got banned for being greedy. Being greedy again with new spotlight on the sub. 

tl;dr, in 2020 the original founder (after being gone for years and did nothing to contribute to the sub), along with a couple of mods, attempted to monetize the sub for personal gains. Users and other mods fought back. Hundreds of users got mass banned for speaking out, mods who spoke out got removed as mods. With some help from users, mods found precedent of another sub creator getting banned for trying to monetize a sub and sent plea to Reddit admins. Reddit admins banned offenders and gave sub back to the good mods. 

u/SpeaksInBooleans (RIP) investigated the circumstance of the events and made video exposing the offenders:

It's important to know/remember this now, because the same person that got exiled for being a tyrant is doing a media circus, trying to ride the current spotlight for personal gain, again.

No single person speaks for the sub and controls its destiny. It is in good hands with u/zjz aka u/SwineFluPandemic

OMG,"GME gang, remember to give back. Tomorrow I'm paying it forward at our local hospital and buying coffee and donuts for our front lines.

While we're still holding, riding this rollercoaster bitch to the fucking moon, please remember to set something aside.  To give back.  To show we're a community of people with heart and soul.  This is an opportunity for us to be better than hedge funds who are fucking the little guy.

GME,"Beware those who are shilling other stocks claiming they're the next GME! They're just trying to get your attention, and they're succeeding! 🚨There is no next GME. As our beloved autist Michael Burry said, GME is a unique situation and a perfect storm. You won't find something like this again. They are just trying to move your attention away from GME and scatter us. From the discussion threads and the posts on the frontpage, it seems that they're succeeding.

[Michael Burry tweet on GME](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355186794640236561?s=19)

Just look at the AMC thread up on the frontpage at the moment. Half the comments are from new accounts with just a handful of karma. AMC is not the next GME. The 'days to cover' on AMC is less than a day. After an initial uptick it will just fizzle out and you'll be left bagholding.

GME,"I emailed a journalist to let him know that WSB is NOT buying silver. His response? He joined the community! Welcome retard, can we make this a trend? Let's open people's eyes to hats really going on. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Here's his article https://thegoldforecast.com/video/silver-benefits-redditt%E2%80%99s-wallstreetbets-forum-there-more-story

My email to him. 
Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best. 
Yours, Jordan. 

P.S I really appreciate that your email address is on your article because even if I don't get a reply it makes you seem very easy to contact... A feature not shared with a lot of journalists. So thank you!

Let's send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment.",58572
LOW,"The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situationI have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place.",58066

OTM,"GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not SquozeDISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
   
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

LAW,"15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It’s rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you’re still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we’re straight only to find out, later, that we’re not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things — sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction — necessarily “prove” your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we’re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we’re not. For example, it’s possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called “mixed orientation” or “cross orientation” — and it’s totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.

- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself.

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn’t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly – like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

GME,RobinHood CEO when responding to Chris Cuomo on why he shut down trading of GME and AMC,54154
GME,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",52990
DAY,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day.Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.

DAY,"Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

I have no idea how this simple metric isn't widely reported. 

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float. Retail is holding on to shares they need and just not letting go, as some of those shares retail has are fraudulent. By the time they run out of money in interest payments dragging this out, it'll be a massive shitshow.

NET,"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

ZAR,"I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",40609
GME,"This is 100% Proof that GME is *literally* in Countdown-to-Launch PhaseOk, fellow mongoloids.  I truly believe I've figured this shit out. 

I've been neglecting sleep and insufflating copious amounts of Colombian blow just so I can remain symbiotically attached to every shred of current market data I could find about GME and its current trajectory. 

So, I'm basically an expert at this point (and so is my cousin who used to work for a NASA contractor in Cocoa Beach, Florida). 

This basically puts me on par with that Cramer guy or whatever. 

Anyway, here's a snapshot of where we stand today:

&#x200B;

Now, I want to draw your attention to to the dimensions of a three-sided polygon (aka triangle) that I created by referencing a few points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth referencing.   


The result of my wizardry is thus:

Now, this is where shit gets interesting. 

I knew there was something uncanny about the shape of this triangle. I fucking knew that I'd seen this EXACT same triangle before in relation to advanced rocketry, but I wasn't sure where. 

So, I contacted my dealer, boofed another eight ball of the Devil's dandruff, and got to work meticulously pouring through all the available data until BAM. I found it.

These three-sided polygons are the SAME. I mean, not ^(exactly) but fuck, it's goddamned close enough to call it. And I'm calling it. 

Motherfucker, if you're not 100% convinced that GME is LITERALLY about to go fucking vertical, then you simply aren't paying attention. It's not my fault if you can't understand basic math, geometry, and astrophysics. 

Ok. My work is done here. After we've all made our millions, I wouldn't mind being handsomely compensated for the selfless efforts I've expended just so you mouthbreathers can have some fun money to throw around at your retirement parties.

POS,"Days ago, Robinhood had the potential to be a major brokerage and a top IPO. Now there's a significant chance they won't surviveBringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

CAN,"DON'T PANIC AND JUST LOOK AT THE FUCKING VOLUMEIf you are panicking go to your shitty robinhood app and change it from a line chart to a candle chart, the top will show you a volume. The total since 9:30 is less than 2 million. Think logically, if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million. There is 7.9 million retards in here. If we all panicked the volume would go through the roof.

This is another attack by hedge funds to force a sell-off and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling.

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED LONGER THAN THEY REMAIN SOLVENT

EDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post. However, there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount.

Notice the huge red dildo staring at your face. Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.

DAY,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could’ve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMCEveryone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕)

OTM,"SEC, DOJ, 60 Minutes – Public data suggests massive securities fraud in which hedge funds and institutions have created more Gamestop shares than actually exist for deliveryObligatory emoji 🚀

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share & AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery.

GME,"A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks InvolvedThere is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions.",35556
GME,"Amid the enthusiasm, there is a dangerous misconception forming that needs to be quashed.I've seen a lot of people on social media and the news spreading the idea that this whole thing was somehow masterminded by /u/DeepFuckingValue within the past 3 weeks. It wasn't and this is some dangerous misinformation as it needlessly makes /u/DFV a target. DFV is simply an eagle-eyed investor who bought into his GME positions quite a while ago, even before anyone here cared about GameStop's fundamentals or the remote possibility of a squeeze. He isn't some mischievous troll who decided sometime in early January to rally all of us into a stock-buying frenzy in order to stick it to some villainous wall street firm, nor did he ever make any special effort to promote GME in order to incite a squeeze. A large number of users here had known of the outsized short interest for a while so this entire thing was the organic result of increasing GME discussion.

This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don’t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.

If there was any doubt of these hedge fund’s influence and manipulate, this whole “WSB going silver” just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.



**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **""There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members""**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.

This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",34139
DID,"Stop reposting the obviously fake screenshot from a robinhood ""insider""WE ARE UNDER A COORDINATED SOCIAL ATTACK IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT WSB. There's a screenshot floating around from a ""robinhood insider"" (u/odin19199, sporting a lovely new user badge) who claimed that they ""overheard"" executives get calls from the white house and whoever the fuck else telling them to shut down GME. I have seen this 69 times today.

How stupid are people that they can actually believe this? YEAH when I'm talking over collusion and market manipulation with the fucking white house I make sure all my IT people can hear me. YEAH totally normal for low-level people to know the intimate details of highly-sensitive conversations.

I can literally make a post right now that suggests your mom traded a cut of that ass to robinhood to restrict buying gme and it would be just as credible. Hell it's even more plausible

MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK. this post is getting spammed to drum up the narrative that this is an alt-right movement, by targeting the white house as the instigator of these holds. If this becomes viral, if we buy into this and start this whole conspiracy based on a single anonymous redditor, we will be forever associated with another qanon conspiracy. we'll be irrelevant in a week.

JUST FUCKING HOLD. NONE OF THIS BULLSHIT MATTERS. HOLD.

Edit: just wanted to be clear - just because something CAN happen does not mean that it DID happen. Sure there is a hypothetical way the US government did this and someone overheard it. Yes, on some level, whether active or systemic, the government is involved. But isn't it more likely these firms, with an incredible incentive to disenfranchise us from the public, made a reddit account and wrote this fanfic for the total cost of $0?",34094

GME,"A MESSAGE FOR GME SHORT SELLERSGood evening you pieces of shit,

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. 

Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.",33689
BRD,"Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total SharesVlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.

#Edit 6: RH is now down to allowing a single share.  Thanks u/shithawks_circling for posting your image - https://imgur.com/a/BRDyxA0",33665

I'm known for never getting the fuck off this sub and collecting tax payer money as I do it. Seriously you'll see me here 24 fucking 7 even when I'm ""working""

I'm going to give you the quick rundown on Wallstreetbets culture for you newcomers to get acclimated or if you're a CNBC boomer not knowing what the fuck is going on in this sub.

# First of all lets go over lingo/slang:

**FD** (stands for ""f"" word (no not fuck the other F word) delight)

\-*To buy an FD is to buy a weekly option that is so fucking retarded it might just work*

**Retard**

\-*It means your fucking stupid and don't know what the fuck you're doing*

**Ameririch**

\-*When US stock markets open and they buy up what Europoors sold*

No you don't need to report users for saying you probably do blowjobs behind the wendys.

If somebody says ""nobody tell him"" they are not being a dick you are just so fucking retarded because your question is probably basic shit you should know before investing.

# Gang Life

On your adventure throughout Wallstreetbets you'll notice some retards representing different types of ""gangs"" heres a quick guide to what they stand for.

**Bear Gang / Gay bears / Virgin traders 🌈🐻**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go down*

*Note: ""gay bear"" in NOT an alternative to calling someone ""retard"". Being called gay bear is 100x worse, true story.*

**Bull Gang / Big Dongus Crew 🐂**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go up*

**Kang Gang 🦘**

**Tanker Gang**🛢️

\-*People that invest in tankers. rip.*

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: This sub was created to lose money. Nothing here is financial advice.**

OTM,"GME EndGame part 3: A new opponent enters the ringWow - what a week. This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true.

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What’s happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options.

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀*

The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

GME,"DO NOT BUY SILVER!Do not try to buy precious metals in the next week while China is celebrating the beginning of their Year of the Metal Ox. Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.

Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.

All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. 

Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. 

The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

> Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

> In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

> **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

~~5 MILLION~~

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

> Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

I will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is a process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I do in the series of edits and comments I made in my original gains post here:

If you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels amazing.

Also, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to ""$35k to $1.25M""?

I'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.

EDIT:

Let me try to answer some of the common questions.

I started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.

Hold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.

Go into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration

Learn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.

Learn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.

LET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.

Do not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.

Don't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.

LEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.

I'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.

EDIT 2:

I will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.

My education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.

EDIT 3:

I usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.

10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.

EDIT 4:

If you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one ""strategy"" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\~ or so from this.

But then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.

Learning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to ""outsmart"" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.

EDIT 6:

Almost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)

EDIT 7:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)

EDIT 8:

Let me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.

EDIT 9:

Many people seem to miss my points from the above giant ass retarded fucking post. So let me write another paragraph you can ignore. Hopping on the same trend is not enough. People pull out too soon, or worse they insist on going the wrong fucking direction. Even with my gains, I pulled out early on so so sooo many trades, with lost gains to the tune of approximately $3\~ mil by my rough estimate. Letting my winners run and not pulling out too quickly let me get some big wins. This was not something easy for me to do, I was always tempted to pull the plug early on my positions but I held most and relied on tight trailing stop losses.",26157

GME,"We are tired of Market Manipulators and corrupted media. This is time to actThis is not about $GME anymore, this is about setting terms straight:

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

FOR,"For those of you missing the ""good 'ol days"" on WSB...I've been around WSB now for about 5 years, mostly as a lurker.  I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing a ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their bank account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

GME,"Evidence points to GME Shorts not having covered but pretending they did (via the use of options to illegally ""cover"" with synthetic long shares) to break the squeezeLong post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. *(This is a re-post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned. I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time.

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

DAY,TOMORROW IS GAME DAY: Here Is A List Of Where To Buy GME. (Do Not Transfer If You Own Elsewhere. Just Hold) Keep Those 💎🤲,22711
GOT,"WHY YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FALL FOR ALL THE SILVER SCAMS!!! CAREFUL, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED BY THE MOST POWERFUL ELITE ON THE PLANET!!!# THIS IS A META THREAD IN WHICH I'M JUST DOING 2 THINGS: RANTING AND LINKING TO OTHER DD THREADS THAT PREDATE GME MOONING BY MONTHS, THUS CALLING BULLSHIT ON THE 6 MILLION NEW DEGENERATES THAT ""HAVE NEVER SEEN A SLV JPM SQUEEZE IDEA IN THIS SUB BEFORE THE SUITS WANTED TO SAVE MELVIN"".

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking ""entry at $450"" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel.

FOR,"Welcome to the battleFor all of you who can't hear the GME battle cries any longer, its due to your ear drums being shattered by all the BS the media has fed you these past few weeks.

There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.

No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.

No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...

But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.

We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.

This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)

BUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what's another 12% mean to me?

Nothing.

I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.

My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.

Well hedgies... I SAY:

FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! KARMA IS A BITCH. TRUST ME. I'VE MET HER. THERE'S NO RUNNING FROM IT. I'VE PAID FOR MY SINS TENFOLD, EVEN WHEN I LAUGHED SAYING ALL OF THAT KARMIC BS WAS  JUST THAT... BS.  But I found out soon enough and I am paying for my wrong doings.

I say this to my enemies.

You know who you are.

""One day. You'll get a\*\* f\*\*\*ed so hard by some event, an event that will enrage you like never before, anger will erupt from the pit of your soul, and for a moment... you'll recall this post, how you were part of the operation that fucked over an entire community of small fish trying to make honest profit while playing by your rules, and you pulled the goddamn plug out of the wall when we started to win.

And you'll realize... ahhh... fuck you karma... well played.""

I've been hammering way OTM weekly calls in volume. This is the most fun I've ever had.

Through the madness of this past week of trading I've managed to claw my way back from oblivion. $GME has done a couple 10 baggers for me this week alone. I love you all and I'm happy to see you all again. So many new faces. I'm proud of each and every one of you.

I'm currently holding about $50,000 in calls on $SLV  ..and $15,000 in OTM weeklies on $GME.  Rookie numbers I know, but I just got my legs back. I'll be running again in no time.

FTD,"I used to work @ Merrill. Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short-squeezing investorsI just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.

I also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.

Disclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.

---------------------------------------------------------
1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: 

When you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.

Enter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the ""title"" for your shares, the folks who make it official.

**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.

In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.

So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a ""failure to deliver""? 

---------------------------

2) **Failure to Deliver**:

Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. 

It has been on the FTD list for a month already. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk


---------------------------

3) **Liability**: 

You must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. 

Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug. This lack of collateral from Robinhood is important to note because the ""music"" never stops, trading low float/volatile shares just becomes much more collateral heavy on the side of the broker.

Hence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)


I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.

---------------------------


Couple of semi-related notes:

-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.

-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?

-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.

-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. 

- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.

- **What will happen now**:Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up.

WAS,"Why GameStop was going to cause a collapse of the entire market, and why it is still going to:**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice, and much of this information is not my own, sourced from other DD’s, many that have been removed.

As many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze.

*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*

Tom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let’s play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.

Tom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.

Vlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.

Tom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.

*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*

Finra’s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.

So, what is the true short interest then?

Well, let’s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024’s data, check out his DD.

***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \~432.56%.***

Last week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***

Now, I know, lol. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?

But I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.

If SI really is \~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.

If this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.

All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.

So now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don’t forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.

It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.

We are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.

So, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.

💎🙌

Edit: Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also **admitted** that they halted to **save themselves**. Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it **WAS NOT** a liquidity issue, but that is his reasoning now. (You can find these 2 interviews on youtube, AutoMod wont let me link youtube)

GME,"Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.",20207
NEW,"Trading Firm Bankrupted After Algorithm Tracking r/wallstreetbets Learns How To YOLO On Weekly OptionsNEW YORK – Amid continued revelations over the outsized influence of Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets on the market, machine-learning trader Cedar Hill Capital declared bankruptcy this week after their algorithm learned how to YOLO 100% of the firm’s funds on a NKLA option expiring the next day. “As Bloomberg recently reported, the market’s big players are all watching and scraping popular forums like r/wallstreetbets for retail trading sentiment analysis,” our market expert noted. “The most advanced use machine learning to predict what moves the traders on Reddit might make next. After just a few hours of studying the forum, bankrupted Cedar Hill’s algo learned to spend literally every dollar the fund had, plus margin and an advance on the company credit card, on 0DTE 9/11 $45 NKLA calls which expired worthless several hours later.”

Observers were quick to point out that Cedar Hill’s algorithm had done exactly what it was designed to do in modeling the behavior of a r/wallstreetbets user. Before being discontinued, the algo also posted a screenshot of its billions in losses to the forum and spent the next day suggesting that other users’ wives had boyfriends.
