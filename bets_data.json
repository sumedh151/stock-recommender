I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.\n\nThose close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.\n\nTo Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.\n\nTo CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.\n\nTo the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these \"millennial blog posts\": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.\n\nTo WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post.

They've been illegally \"closing out\" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**\n\nSo this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.\n\nI started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.\n\nWhat was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.\n\nHaving spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf\n\nIn it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:\n\n\"Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A\u2019s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as \u201creset transactions,\u201d in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm\u2019s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.\"\n\nIt's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.\n\nI 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.\n\nI am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.\n\nMore DD: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n\nNot a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner\n\nEDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:\n\n* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts\n\n* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.\n\n* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. \n\n* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. \n\n* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. \n\n* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.\n\n\nIf I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.\n\nWE LIKE THE STOCK \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f", "stonks": ["RIP", "XYZ", "GME", "ONE", "ETF"]}, {"create_time": "01/28/2021, 12:43:23", "title": "LET THE PEOPLE TRADE!", "score": 86078, "body": "", "stonks": ["LET"]}, {"create_time": "02/02/2021, 11:43:13", "title": "Porn addict hasn\u2019t masturbated in 54 days and $GME is breaking his will", "score": 85973, "body": "", "stonks": ["GME"]}, {"create_time": "02/01/2021, 07:08:11", "title": "There is no silver short squeeze happening.

In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday\n\n>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers\u2019 attempt to corner the market on the metal.\n\n-\n>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926\u20132014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers\u2019 Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.\n\n-\n>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged\u2014March 27\u2014silver fell to $10.80, the metal\u2019s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, \u201cA billion dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.\n\n-\n>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R.

Why?\nBecause they\u2019re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.\n\nSo let\u2019s see what tactics they are using:\n\n**Short ladder attacks**:\n\nWhat is a short ladder attack? \nThe big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it \"looks\" like the stock is plummeting. It\u2019s only effective if we would sell. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nJust look at the volume.

Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There\u2019s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Manipulating the Media**: \n\nHere are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8x7g/bloomberg_now_insisting_gme_is_old_news_ha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nNow let\u2019s get some clarification on **SILVER:**\n\nThere is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don\u2019t seem to realize 3 things:\n\n1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)\u00a0\n2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.\u00a0\n3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing this narrative in the media.\u00a0\n\nSLV inverting GME: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nThe amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.\n\n**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that\u2019s just my retard opinion. \n\n**SILVER ISN\u2019T \u201cREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY\u201c.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.\n\nSilver squeeze not happening links: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nWell. Let\u2019s see to what extend they fucked up exactly:\u00a0\n\n**Short Version:**\nThe short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails\u2013to\u2013deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.\n\nThere are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.\n\nOn top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options \u2013 both ITM and OTM).  \n\nOnce you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.\n\nLong version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n**At these levels it\u2019s NOT about the price, it\u2019s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That\u2019s why they want you to sell so bad.**\n\n\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\n\nLast but not least I\u2019m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: \n\n__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  \n\n__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\n[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\n__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird", "stonks": ["BUY", "GME", "XKP"]}, {"create_time": "01/30/2021, 17:44:06", "title": "ROBINHOOD WILL HAVE TO BREAK INTO MY WIFE\u2019S BOYFRIEND\u2019S HOUSE IF THEY WANT TO FORCE ME TO SELL MY GME", "score": 68381, "body": "", "stonks": ["GME"]}, {"create_time": "02/10/2021, 09:44:56", "title": "Weed gang \ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33", "score": 68370, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "01/29/2021, 13:53:15", "title": "\ud83d\ude80D I A M O N D \ud83d\udc8e H A N D S \ud83d\udc50", "score": 68232, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "01/31/2021, 09:35:33", "title": "Only 47% left to go !!", "score": 67798, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "02/14/2021, 08:11:58", "title": "My Awesome WSB Birthday Cake - HOLD \ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32", "score": 67742, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "01/30/2021, 10:55:58", "title": "Hear me out.

However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. \"The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!\", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**\n\nHere is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.\n\nFor you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [\"Counterfeiting Stock 2.0\"](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, \"strategic fails\u2013to\u2013deliver.\" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.\n\nThis completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.\n\nThere are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.\n\nMoreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\\~\\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\\~\\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**\n\nGME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails\u2013to\u2013deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \\~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.\n\nHow many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:\n\n[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \\(x-axis\\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \\(y-axis\\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)\n\nI think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**\n\n*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*\n\nDisclaimer: I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance.

On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.\n\nEDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.\n\nEDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.\n\nEDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the \"3 shares per wsb subscriber thing\". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per \"legit subscriber\" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.\n\nEDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say \"Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**\" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.\n\nEDIT 5: [Backup link for white paper.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210131014127/counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\nEDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages.

In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)\u2014or 125% (25 \u00f7 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  \n  \n  \nIn cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  \n   \n  \nI have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  \n  \n  \n[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  \n\nSo we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   \n  \n  \nInstitutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  \n  \n  \nWith this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I\u2019d share my own personal thoughts.**\n\n# The bull thesis\n\nTo date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.\n\nIt\u2019s rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you\u2019re still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.\n\nOne braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a \"times-revenue\" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.\n\nThis isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.\n\nWorking backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.\n\nWhat multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:\n\n* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.\n* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.\n* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.\n* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.\n\nSo is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?\n\nHow you judge that determines your exit strategy.\n\n# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride\n\nMaybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.\n\nIf I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.\n\n# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear\n\nYou've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.\n\nIf I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.\n\n# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands\n\nYou've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.\n\nIf I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.\n\n# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue\n\nIF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN\n\n# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?\n\nThe best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.\n\n# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?\n\nThis must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.\n\n# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?\n\nWho knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.\n\n# FAQ 4: How long will this take?\n\nCould be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.\n\n# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?\n\nThe idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.\n\n# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?\n\nGet this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.\n\n# FAQ 7: Am I gay?\n\nMany of us grow up to assume that we\u2019re straight only to find out, later, that we\u2019re not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things \u2014 sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction \u2014 necessarily \u201cprove\u201d your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we\u2019re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we\u2019re not. For example, it\u2019s possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called \u201cmixed orientation\u201d or \u201ccross orientation\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.\n\n\nEdit:\n- Thank you for all the awards and comments!\n- I didn\u2019t write the gay part at the end. Read more [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/am-i-gay) if you\u2019re... ahem... curious.\n- For the new folks who keep trying to fondle my balls, I\u2019m not some genius or WSB autist-in-chief, I\u2019m a bit player. I can\u2019t get intercede with the mods or whatever you want me to do.\n- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself.\n\n**Important:** This post is very outdated now but it\u2019s still getting comments, so if you\u2019re just seeing this for the first time make sure you\u2019re caught up on the current state of the market and all the other, more recent posts about GME.", "stonks": ["FAQ", "ISP", "GME"]}, {"create_time": "02/01/2021, 21:19:19", "title": "Courtesy of u/terribletraderIG - This is the caliber of memes that were posted before there were 1M subs.", "score": 55920, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "02/02/2021, 16:18:35", "title": "To all \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c who are too low karma to post", "score": 55713, "body": "I\u2019m sure this time is toughest for those of us who don\u2019t fit the account requirements of this sub who are feeling alone and stressed out.\n\nSomeone PM\u2019d me asking if I thought $GME would actually go back up to $400 (Duh of course it will) so I assumed he was a bot, but after checking his account I saw he was supporting $GME a week prior to the new karma requirements.

It\u2019s a fucking global movement now (or not \u2013 could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8eand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy \u2013 we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven\u2019t understand the concept or how this works \u2013 speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up \u2013 desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors \u2013 shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious \u2013 you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let\u2019s be fucking honest \u2013 most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody \u2013 I even don\u2019t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).\n\n**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**\n\nDeal with it \u2013 we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That\u2019s it. If we are right \u2013 this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock \u2013 do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought \u2013 hmmmm makes sense \u2013 I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \\[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don\u2019t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) \u2013 no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the \ud83d\ude80 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.\n\nSo please \u2013 no post without \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and if you want to fukn leave the party \u2013 leave \u2013 but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.\n\nP.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I\u2019d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  \u2013 I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e \n\nEdit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \\- so you can simply award his original post referenced.

Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.\n\nThere's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.\n\nLater in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, \"I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please.\" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, \"Sorry, we're all sold out.\" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.\n\nMelvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.\n\nThe price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.\n\n\\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\\]\n\n\\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.\n\nIn a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.\n\nFor those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\\]", "stonks": ["IOU", "GME"]}, {"create_time": "02/01/2021, 16:05:11", "title": "Been an AMC employee for 5+ years, so thanks for bailing us out and saving my job.

To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.\n\nEdit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. \n\nEdit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.\n\nJPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.\n\nPE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer.

Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.\n\nDoes the Firm have to close out the positions? \u2705\n\n>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (\"participant\")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.

(GME)", "score": 41651, "body": "Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.\n\nI know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**\n\nAs we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.\n\n[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)\n\n[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)\n\nPer S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.\n\nWell lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.\n\nTo establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.\n\nThis means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**\n\nNow, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**\n\nLastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.\n\nSo even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.\n\nThis likely didn't happen, for several reasons. \n\nFirst, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.\n\nSecond, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. \n\nThird, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. \n\nFourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** \n\nWhat is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**\n\nThat means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.\n\n**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**\n\nNow this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.\n\n[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)\n\n[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)\n\nNow I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**\n\nS3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.\n\n[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)\n\nSo on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**\n\n**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**\n\nFurthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.\n\n[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.\n\nThey then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?\n\nThere was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? \n\n**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**\n\n[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)\n\nShorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**\n\nThere were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.\n\nWhy was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. \n\nThey want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.\n\nTLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions.

Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\n\nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\n\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\n\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\n\nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\n\nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade.

Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like \"money market fund\" or \"moving average\"\n\nSomething like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.\n\nInstead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS \"difficult solution\" they did.\n\nAnd speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying \"lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors\". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.\n\nAnd yeah another reason why \"volatiilty\" and \"trade volume\" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.\n\nEdit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl\n\n\nEdit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....\n\n\n#FUCK YOU ROBINTARD.

You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.\n\nSo with recent events, you must ask yourself:\n\n# Who is Your Counterparty?\n\nNothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. \n\n# Know Everyone's Hand\n\nYour guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.\n\nRemember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? \n\nYou are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.\n\n# Know What Can Go Wrong\n\nNobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.\n\n# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose\n\nThis one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***\n\n# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital\n\nIf you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. \n\nThere are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.\n\nSecondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. \n\nThirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake.

Peak value was nearly 500k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b\n\n*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*\n\n\\*\\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\\*\\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.\n\nHere's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**\n\nThere is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.\n\nHow do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.\n\n**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**\n\n1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.\n2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.\n3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.\n4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.\n5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:\n   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.\n   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling\n   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver\n   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),\n   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**\n\n***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.\n\n**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**\n\n* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?\n   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e4mes1qf5f61.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb3da83d0aaaeb2256e11bf7a3e3eaf8b31de90\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\\*\\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\\*\\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.\n* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?\n   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?\n   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)\n\n**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**\n\n* Claim: assuming \\~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.\n* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.\n\n|Date|Trade Volume|\n|:-|:-|\n|2/2 Tue|77.8m|\n|2/1 Mon|37.3m|\n|1/29 Fri|50.5m|\n|1/28 Thu|58.5m|\n|1/27 Wed|93.3m|\n\n**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**\n\n* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit\n* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**\n\n* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.\n* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS\n* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2\n\n* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.\n* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.\n* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**\n\n* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.\n* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\\_representation\\_of\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack\\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)\n   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)\n* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\\_ladders\\_are\\_not\\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)\n* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\\\\n* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?\n* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**\n\n* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.\n* Evidence: A single, solitary chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131\n\n* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?\n* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill edit with more, my primate fingers are hurting from trying to press the keys and my handler needs to readjust my helmet.", "stonks": ["GME"]}, {"create_time": "01/24/2021, 08:01:12", "title": "How'd you guys manage to win so big it made these old guys drown in their tears?", "score": 35277, "body": "#Theres 2 million of you. that is so crazy yet amazing when you think about it.\n\n##If you haven't noticed,  all eyes are on /r/wallstreetbets right now and a certain narrative is being pushed around to make it seem as if this community is disorderly and reckless.

Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. \n\nThis is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. \n\nThey are simultaneously:\n1)  manipulating the system\n2) taking advantage of people with less funds\n3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased\n\nThey did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say \u201cWe reopened stock purchase of GME\u201d and nobody will dig deeper. \n\nThis is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. \n\nHere\u2019s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa\n\nEdit: and yes.

Thomas \u201cThe Shit Engine\u201d Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it\u2019s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what\u2019s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo\n\nEdit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.\n\nEdit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.\n\nHere\u2019s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg\n\n#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven\u2019t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true.\n\n# Previous Important Posts\n\n* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven\u2019t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close\n* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.\n* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.\n\n# What\u2019s happened thus far\n\n## Why did GME go up on Friday?\n\nThe story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:\n\n* Organic buying\n   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME\u2019s future\n   * There\u2019s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)\n   * The Citron Backfire\n      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary\u2019s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.\n      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left\u2019s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**\n      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.\n   * Larger investors piling in\n      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we\u2019d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)\n* Gamma squeeze\n   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won\u2019t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.\n* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.\n* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.\n\nHowever, not many people have talked about why it **went down**\n\n## Why did GME come down?\n\nHere\u2019s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.\n\nSo Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?\n\nThis is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.\n\n**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**\n\nMarket-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don\u2019t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for \u201cliquidity purposes\u201d. They also have the ability to halt trading.\n\nThere were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.\n\nHowever, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)\n\nMy speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.\n\nNotice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.\n\nAll this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.\n\n## A repeat on Monday\n\nThe short ladder attack repeated on Monday.\n\nGME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)\n\nBoth days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**\n\nNow, I kept wondering - why would MM\u2019s take the side of the shorts? What\u2019s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.\n\nBut then the news hit today:\n\n# A new opponent enters the ring:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c\n\nThat\u2019s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin\u2019s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME\u2019s share price.\n\n**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You\u2019re missing the big one.**\n\n# Now what?\n\nShorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they\u2019ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron\u2019s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they\u2019ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**\n\nOn the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day\u2019s high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368\n\nWhat this tells me is that GME\u2019s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail\u2019s buying of options.\n\nWe\u2019re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.\n\nSome shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**\n\nThe short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They\u2019ve got more fingers in the dam, but it\u2019s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**\n\nAnd, for some reason, the SEC still doesn\u2019t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it\u2019s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered \u201cshort squeeze\u201d.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429\n\n# Margin impacts:\n\nNote that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.\n\nThis also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.\n\nThat means it\u2019s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you\u2019re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you\u2019ll need the exact same capital as if you\u2019d bought the shares, so it\u2019s up to you on this.\n\nFor shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.\n\n# My speculation\n\n* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It\u2019s possible they can\u2019t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I\u2019m sure they can see what\u2019s happening.\n* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.\n\n# Things to be careful about\n\nAs you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here\u2019s some things to be careful about.\n\n* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don\u2019t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that\u2019s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.\n* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn\u2019t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.\n* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I\u2019m not specifically going to share them here because I don\u2019t want to give the ideas circulation, but\n   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don\u2019t copy others and don\u2019t try to be memey. Make your own decisions.\n   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it\u2019s an **attack vector** for you.\n* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn\u2019t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you\u2019re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.\n* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you\u2019d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you\u2019ll get to margin call faster.\n* **Don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I\u2019ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I\u2019ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.\n* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It\u2019s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you\u2019ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do your own DD. I\u2019m holding over $1M in shares and calls.\n\n# 1/26 Update\n\nHi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  \n\nHope you all made a ton of money today!\n\n**Quick Notes:**\n\n* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. \n* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. \n* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. \n* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. \n* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. \n* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality\n   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon\u2019s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*\n\n1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. \"Hey son, I heard you like games.

However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading.

S3's way says 80%.\n\nKnowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade \"longs whose shares were borrowed away to short\") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22\n\nThat is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*disclaimer ripped this off some guy on tradingview, but havent seen it on here (ETCH1234)\n\nEdits: 14 shares @ Avg 110 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e This is not financial advice but I do have a rock hard boner.\n\nTLDR: HEDGE CHANGE MATH MAKE NUMBER GO DOWN, NUMBER GOOD FOR APE.

For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.\n\nEventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you. \n\nOnce the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.\n\nWhen things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.\n\nI've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.\n\nSome people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck.

If you haven't watched it, you should. \n\nWhile you were sleeping last night (night of 2/3), moderators who wanted to profit from THIS community, removed the moderators you know and love. They were replaced with brand new accounts. Literally minutes old. It was a coup. \n\nThe long and short of it is, there was a movie deal. In fact, there was more than one. There were dollar signs in their eyes. The Gamestop catalyst that propelled our community to over 8 million members attracted media attention, naturally. It's no secret [he who must not be named sold out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-wallstreetbets-founder-sells-life-story-to-movie-producer-ratpac-entertainment-11612440001), as he has [in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoF3jH7yG4), and some of the bad moderators were just a little behind him. \n\nFor this reason, some moderators are no longer with us. They tried to go behind other moderator's backs to secure money for themselves, and monetize this subreddit. They even went as far to establish a website (blomberg.com) to intercept all media traffic so they themselves could profit. \n\nSo the Reddit Admins intervened. \n\nSome of the moderators who grew this community, like u/zjz still have not been added back. Perhaps they will be back in the future. The good news is, the right moderators, the mods you all know and love, are coming back, and some already are here. People I know wouldn't take a dime, are taking back control, one meme filled shitpost at a time. \n\nHe who must not be named still has a movie deal, so I leave you with this question: \n\n**How do you feel about a guy who has been scamming people for most of his adult life, getting paid six figures for a movie deal partially about scamming members of WallStreetBets?**\n\nOne more thing...

To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?\n2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of \"dumb money\" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.\n3. **\\*WHY\\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.\n4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be \"investors\" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.\n5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.\n6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?\n\nAnyways, there is a list 3 miles long.\n\nGameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.\n\nGood Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years. Let that sink in.\n\nEdit: This blew up, appreciate all the support!\n\nI recently saw this video, it's 10 minutes long, but the ***first 3 are incredibly important!***  \n***Jim Cramer*** exposes what illegal activities hedge funds and short sellers do to manipulate the market.

Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.\n\nAll the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.\n\nI'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nSo let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:\n\n**# of Shares - Price**\n\nx 20 - $0.30c\n\nx 80 - $5\n\nx 400 - $20\n\nx 600 - $40\n\nx 900 - $60\n\nx 2,000 - $100\n\nx 5,000 - $150\n\nx 10,000 - $200\n\nx 30,000 - $300\n\nx 50,000 - $400\n\nx 150,000 - $500\n\nx 1 mil - $1,000\n\nx 15 mil - $5,000\n\nx 30 mil - $69,420\n\nGet it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.\n\nGet it?\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nThey need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.", "stonks": ["GME"]}, {"create_time": "07/23/2020, 15:56:54", "title": "It's not about money...it\u2019s about sending a message.", "score": 28014, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "02/02/2021, 18:45:55", "title": "AUSTRALIAN APE SEES INTO FUTURE", "score": 28001, "body": "", "stonks": ["APE"]}, {"create_time": "02/18/2021, 12:27:01", "title": "They still never appear live at the same time...", "score": 27993, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "05/17/2020, 20:00:01", "title": "a wise man once said", "score": 27914, "body": "", "stonks": []}, {"create_time": "02/09/2020, 05:04:13", "title": "Quit my job to trade for a living, ended up losing everything... wasted 4 years of my life.", "score": 27900, "body": "I have always worked a low paid job earning only about the equivalent of $25k a year.

Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.\n\nAll of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. \n\nDon't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. \n\nThe US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. \n\nPay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.\n\nPay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.\n\nThe important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.\n\nDon't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.\n\nAnd most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.\n\nEDIT - We've got a usual stickied thread sorted by new, thanks mods!

In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in \u201cthreshold securities\u201d if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.

But to put it succinctly. There is a process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I do in the series of edits and comments I made in my original gains post here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k\\_590k\\_in\\_3\\_months/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k_590k_in_3_months/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nIf you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels amazing.\n\nAlso, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to \"$35k to $1.25M\"?\n\nI'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\n\nI started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.\n\nHold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.\n\nGo into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration\n\nLearn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.\n\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.\n\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.\n\nDo not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.\n\nDon't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.\n\nLEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.\n\nI'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.\n\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nI usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.\n\n10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nIf you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\\~ or so from this.\n\nBut then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.\n\nLearning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to \"outsmart\" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \\~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)\n\nEDIT 7:\n\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)\n\nEDIT 8:\n\nLet me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.\n\nEDIT 9:\n\nMany people seem to miss my points from the above giant ass retarded fucking post. So let me write another paragraph you can ignore. Hopping on the same trend is not enough. People pull out too soon, or worse they insist on going the wrong fucking direction. Even with my gains, I pulled out early on so so sooo many trades, with lost gains to the tune of approximately $3\\~ mil by my rough estimate. Letting my winners run and not pulling out too quickly let me get some big wins. This was not something easy for me to do, I was always tempted to pull the plug early on my positions but I held most and relied on tight trailing stop losses.", "stonks": ["DIS", "DAL", "CUT", "LUV", "AAL", "UAL", "SPY", "ITM", "MBA", "ATH", "YTD", "OTM", "LET", "IRA"]}, {"create_time": "01/09/2021, 15:34:42", "title": "TSLA - Best $100K I\u2019ve ever spent.

One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.\n\nThe total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. \n\nIf you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking \"wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?\" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. \n\nGood luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95.

The box spreads that \"literally can't go tits up\".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of \"he who shall not be named\" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.\n\nOver the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.\n\nFirst of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.\n\nEven worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.\n\n**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**\n\nWSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing a \"load of crap\".\n\nWe all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.\n\nLet the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.\n\nBut for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their bank account.\n\nSo to all the noobs:\n\nWelcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.  \n\n\nEdit: getting a lot of flack for no emojis so I'd just like to add \ud83d\udcc8\ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\udcaa", "stonks": ["LOT", "GME", "FOR"]}, {"create_time": "01/28/2021, 03:25:25", "title": "Guys Micheal Burry, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Daddy Elon Musk, Mia Khalifa, Thomas, THE SEC, THE WHITE HOUSE, and many others are all watching and most are rooting for us.", "score": 23093, "body": "They have tweeted to their millions of followers.

Full details below.\n\nThere\u2019s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.\n\nThe first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nPlummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out\u2026 Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nThe second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn\u2019t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further \u201cbreaking the squeeze.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nThe way the hedge funds could have done this \u2014 made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn\u2019t \u2014 involves trickery in the options market.\n\nThe tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a \u201crisk alert\u201d memo on the topic in August 2013.\n\nThe SEC memo is titled \u201cStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.\u201d You can\u00a0[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\n\nThe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.\n* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock \u2014 meaning they are now \u201cshort\u201d the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) \u2014 and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.\n* The shares bought against the call options could be \u201csynthetic\u201d longs \u2014 meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock \u2014 as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.\n* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of \u201cnaked shorting\u201d as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.\n* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn\u2019t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.\n* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have \u201cbought back\u201d their short position via buying long shares \u2014 except they actually haven\u2019t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker\u2019s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.\n\nIt gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they\u2019ve covered their shorts \u2014 even if they haven\u2019t truly covered, and can\u2019t, for lack of available float \u2014 by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.\n\nBelow is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:\n\n***\u201cTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****\u201d**\n\n\\*\\*\n\nIn short (no pun intended) these tricks\u00a0\u201chelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren\u2019t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located\u201d. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry\u2019s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.\n\nThese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren\u2019t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to \u201ccover\u201d short positions they shouldn\u2019t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.\n\nIf this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes \"its only a loss when you sell.\" The version for shorts would be \"its only a loss if you close out your short positions.\"\n\nAnother factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)\n\nIn addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.\n\nI would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.\n\nIn considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.\n\n**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)\n\n**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)\n\nSidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the \"new\" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.\n\nIf you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.\n\nThere's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay \"retarded\" longer than funds can stay solvent. The \"paper hand\" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)\n\nAt least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:\n\n* **\"Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.\"** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.\n* **\"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.\"** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.\n* **\"If his forces are united, separate them\"** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving \"weak-hands\" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some \"paper hands\", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.\n\nI will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further.

Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy #1 just because we believe in an underdog company getting a second chance. \n\nWe don\u2019t have billionaires to bail us out when we mess up our portfolio risk and a position goes against us.

Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.\n\nI also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.\n\nDisclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: \n\nWhen you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.\n\nEnter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the \"title\" for your shares, the folks who make it official.\n\n**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.\n\nIn addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.\n\nSo, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a \"failure to deliver\"? \n\n---------------------------\n\n2) **Failure to Deliver**:\n\nFailure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. \n\nIt has been on the FTD list for a month already. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n3) **Liability**: \n\nYou must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. \n\nRobinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug. This lack of collateral from Robinhood is important to note because the \"music\" never stops, trading low float/volatile shares just becomes much more collateral heavy on the side of the broker.\n\nHence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)\n\n\nI personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nCouple of semi-related notes:\n\n-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.\n\n-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?\n\n-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.\n\n-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. \n\n- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.\n\n- **What will happen now**:Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up.\n\nedit (2/1/21): Thanks for all the awards.

While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let\u2019s play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.\n\nTom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.\n\nVlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.\n\nTom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.\n\n*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*\n\nFinra\u2019s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.\n\nSo, what is the true short interest then?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:\n\nInsider Ownership: 23,704,787\n\nInstitutions: 151,000,000\n\nFunds: 40,000,000\n\nRetail: 38,595,000\n\nTotal Owned: 253,299,787\n\nTotal Outstanding: 69,746,960\n\nPercentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%\n\nEstimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827\n\nFINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%\n\nFinviz Float: 50,650,000\n\nReported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624\n\nTotal Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)\n\n219,091,451\n\nPercentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%\n\nIf you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024\u2019s data, check out his DD.\n\n***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \\~432.56%.***\n\nLast week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME\u2019s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***\n\nNow, I know, lol. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?\n\nBut I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.\n\nIf SI really is \\~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xlj4jhdcji61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1ae42ae38e27ff4f6b2b82d8cfe2ffe52654610\n\nIf this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.\n\nAll of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.\n\nSo now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don\u2019t forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.\n\nIt is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.\n\nWe are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.\n\nSo, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit: Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also **admitted** that they halted to **save themselves**.

For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility.

After just a few hours of studying the forum, bankrupted Cedar Hill\u2019s algo learned to spend literally every dollar the fund had, plus margin and an advance on the company credit card, on 0DTE 9/11 $45 NKLA calls which expired worthless several hours later.\u201d\n\nObservers were quick to point out that Cedar Hill\u2019s algorithm had done exactly what it was designed to do in modeling the behavior of a r/wallstreetbets user.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.", "stonks": []}]
